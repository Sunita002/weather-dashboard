# Weather Dashboard

## Project Background:
To use Third-party APIs that allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. For this challeneg, I will build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.
